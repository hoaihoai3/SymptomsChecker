# SymptomsChecker Privacy Policy
Symptoms Checker understands how important the privacy of personal
information is to our users. This Privacy Policy will tell you what information we
collect about you and about your use of Symptoms Checker and its services. It
will explain the choices you have about how your personal information is used
and how we protect that information. We urge you to read this Privacy Policy
carefully.
We refer to the Symptoms Checker Application, along with the information and
services made available to you through the Symptoms Checker App as the
“Services.” This Privacy Policy also applies to the consumer-facing version of
the Symptoms Checker Health Manager Product. However, if you are an
employee or health plan member who has enabled access to your health record
at Symptoms Checker by registering at your employer&#39;s or health plan&#39;s
webapplication, the privacy policy applicable to your information at your
employer&#39;s or health plan&#39;s webapplication remains applicable to your personal
health record at Symptoms Checker. If your employer or health plan account is
no longer made available to you by your employer or health plan, you will
continue to have access to your health information from Symptoms Checker,
using the same username and password, but will be subject to this Privacy
Policy.
Except where noted, statements in this Privacy Policy with respect to the
Symptoms Checker Applications also apply to the Apps. If you do not want us

to collect, use or disclose information about you and your use of the Services
as described in this Privacy Policy, then you should not use the Services. By
using the Services, you must agree to the Symptoms Checker Terms of Use,
which is the contract between us and users of the Services.  By accepting the
Symptoms Checker Terms of Use, you confirm that you have read and
understand this Privacy Policy and the Symptoms Checker Cookie Policy and
you acknowledge that we will store, use and otherwise process your
information in the United States where we are located.
References to &quot;Symptoms Checker,&quot; “we” or “us” mean Symptoms Checker
LLC, including any company that Symptoms Checker LLC controls (for
example, a subsidiary that Symptoms Checker LLC owns). Symptoms Checker
may share information among its subsidiaries or webapplications that it owns
or controls, but information collected under this Privacy Policy is always
protected under the terms of this Privacy Policy. Except as otherwise noted in
this Privacy Policy, Symptoms Checker LLC is the data controller responsible for
the processing of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.
